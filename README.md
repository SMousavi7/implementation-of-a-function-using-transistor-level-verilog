In our logic circuit course we had to solve some questions and one of them was this. In this question we had to implement this function: $F(A,B,C,D)=AB+ABC'+BD'+A'C'D'$.

and after that we had to make a test-bench file for it. 

I wrote every possible situation for A and B and C and D as a test-bench. I hope it is useful for you.
